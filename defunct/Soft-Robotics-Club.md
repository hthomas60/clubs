##SOFT ROBOTIS CLUB
*Last modified 2017-08-28*

##Purpose

Soft Robotics club is created to provide students with the opportunity to explore the field of soft robotics. Soft Robotics is the study of robots that have few to no ridged parts. The Soft Robotics Club focuses on teaching soft robotics through both hands on projects reading scientific literature.

##Membership

Any student can join the Soft Robotics Club. In order to participate in the fabrication of soft robots, members will have to go through a safety briefing with Soft Robotics Club leadership. People will be considered active members if they attend at least 50% of events. Members must help set up or clean up every time at Soft Robotics Club meetings to remain members.

##Officers and Roles

There are two positions in Soft Robotics Club: President and general member. The role of the President (one or more individuals) is responsible for organizing meetings and events, managing purchasing requests, appointing positions for the following year, managing the club supplies (storage, what to buy, etc.), teaching new members fundamentals of soft robot fabrication, and is the prime person responsible for the safety of the club's members. They establish and enforce safety protocol, and put away supplies.

##Transition Protocol

The president will name the leadership of the following year. Other members of the club can pitch their ideas or nominations, but it is ultimately up to the president. Presidents can name as many members President as they deem necessary to run the club.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Soft Robotics Club requires a food scale, plastic cups and a toaster oven as well as consumable materials such as Ecoflex 00-30, non-latex gloves, and tongue depressors.  All materials will be stored with the President until a more permanent storage space can be obtained. As stated before, the President will be in charge of purchases. Any member of the club is welcome to use materials but must get usage approved by the president.

##Events and Activities

Events will be held whenever the President feels like it. They will be held on approximately a weekly basis.

##Amendment Procedure

At any point during the semester, members of the club can propose an amendment to the charter. If that amendment is approved by at least 50% of active members (including at least one President), it is law.
